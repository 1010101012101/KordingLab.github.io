title: Paper Writing 101
---

This document is meant to give a simple check list for paper writing (journal articles) in cognitive science and neuroscience, originally put together for the Kording lab. It includes a range of insights I adapted from the (highly recommendable) and more general list by [Dan Simons](http://www.dansimons.com/resources/writing_tips.html). Also added some ideas from Tony Zador. Comments are welcome. Keep in mind that these rules (under rare circumstances) may be broken.
