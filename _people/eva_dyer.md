### News

- A new paper out on arXiv! Convex Relaxation Regression (CoRR)
- We are organizing a workshop to discuss new approaches for tackling big neural datasets!! The workshop will be held Dec. 12th, 2015 in Montreal as part of the NIPS workshop series. BigNeuro 2015: Making sense of big neural data

### Bio


I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Bayesian Behavior Lab](http://klab.smpp.northwestern.edu/wiki/index.php5/Main_Page) at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Before joining, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Rice University under the supervision of [Richard Baraniuk](http://web.ece.rice.edu/richb/). In 2007, I received a BSEE from the University of Miami with a double major in Audio Engineering and Physics. While at the University of Miami, I worked for the Edward Arnold Center for Confluent Media Studies as a multimedia designer and an assistant sound designer for the documentary [One Water: A collaborative effort for a sustainable future](http://www.onewater.org/movie). In 2014, I co-designed and served as the Matlab content guru for the initial launch of [301x](https://www.edx.org/course/discrete-time-signals-systems-part-1-ricex-elec301-1x), an edX course on Discrete-Time Signals and Systems.
