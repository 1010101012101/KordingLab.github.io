## About

#### Background

I obtained my PhD at Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland, at the [Brain Research Unit](http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/BRU), an independent experimental neuroimaging research institute within the [OV Lounasmaa Laboratory](http://ltl.tkk.fi/). The BRU pioneered the development of the first commercial systems for whole-scalp, human [magnetoencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography), a technique that measures the electrical activity of the brain by sensing weak magnetic fields outside the head. I worked with Profs. Riitta Hari, Lauri Parkkonen, and Aapo Hyvärinen, studying neuromagnetic oscillations, resting-state networks, signal processing for inverse modeling, and building decoding models of visual perception. For details, see list of publications below and a research statement from my time in graduate school.

I also have an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati in Guwahati, India, and a Masters degree in Bioinformatics from Helsinki University of Technology (subsequently, Aalto University).

#### Long-term goals

I would like to apply my background in signal processing, neural data analysis, statistics and applied machine learning to produce integrative accounts of sensory and perceptual phenomena of the mind/brain spanning the David Marr levels of description — computational, algorithmic, and mechanistic.

During this postdoc phase, I intend to enrich my understanding of concepts in theoretical neuroscience, psychophysics, and Bayesian modeling of behavior, while seeking to enhance my neural data analysis and machine learning skills. I primarily analyze single-unit and multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings from chronic electrodes in monkeys.

#### Guiding principle

How do I know if what I'm doing is important? In other words, what criteria do I use for saying no to a project?

As I navigate a transition in my research direction, both in terms of tools and questions, I am very inspired by the idea of Inventing on Principle, which I interpret as a talisman that one can occasionally consult in the process of picking fruitful fields of endeavor. A talisman I occasionally consult is to ask myself: in whatever I publish, am I furthering the bridges between Marr's three levels?

## Ongoing projects

The common thread in my projects is neural data analysis; in particular, encoding models of, and functional connectivity between populations of spiking neurons recorded from chronic extracellular arrays in monkeys. I use generalized linear models (GLM) of linear-nonlinear Poisson (LNP) spiking neurons (see [1], [2], [3]).

GLMs applied to time series of spike trains are multiple linear regression models followed by an exponential or similar nonlinearity that guarantees positive firing rates and captures Poisson-like variability of neurons. They are closely related to multivariate point-process models and ARMAX models in statistical signal processing. They have a rich expressive power — capturing phenomena such as bursting, adaptation, and gain modulation — while simultaneously guaranteeing global optima owing to their convex likelihood functions. Here is an excellent NIPS tutorial talk by Jonathan Pillow.

My current projects include:
