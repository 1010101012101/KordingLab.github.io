### About

My current research at Northwestern/RIC is focused on predicting patient outcomes in the clinical rehabilitation domain using wearable sensors and machine learning models. The overarching goal of this research is to: 1) build models that can help clinicians plan rehabilitation protocols; 2) understand the benefits of new rehab technologies in terms of functional recovery (e.g. does an advanced prosthetic leg allow a patient to walk more?).

I received my MSc in Biomedical Engineering from University Campus Bio-medico of Rome, Italy and my PhD in Computer Science from Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

During my MSc I worked on a model of the acquisition and retention of motor tasks to optimize robotic neuro-rehabilitation (in collaboration with the Newman Lab at MIT). Throughout my PhD I worked on a method for [unsupervised learning of active stereo-vision](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819528/) on the humanoid robot iCub using Sparse Coding and Reinforcement Learning. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuA6OU2VdhE&feature=youtu.be) of the result.

### News

Our new paper **"Activity Recognition in Patients with Lower Limb Impairments: Do we need training data from each patient?"** has been accepted at ([http://embc.embs.org/2016/](EMBC 2016))! This year's topic is _"Empowering Individual Healthcare Decisions through Technology"_<br>

### Current projects

#### How specific an activity recognition classifier needs to be?

#### Using wearable accelerometers to detect everyday activities in patients walking with a leg brace

It has been argued that computer controlled orthoses, e.g. the C-brace ([http://c-brace.ottobock.com](http://c-brace.ottobock.com)) allow people affected by lower limb disabilities to be more active. This should be expected as a traditional stance control orthosis (SCO) does not allow the same adaptive setting of impedance. Here we use machine-learning enabled measurements of everyday activity using an accelerometer to compare the physical activities between the two types of orthoses, as patients wear them over one month.
