# Kording lab's blog

Follow instruction [here](https://jekyllrb.com/) to install Jekyll. To run jekyll server locally on your computer, use `jekyll serve`.


### How to add posts

It's very easy to add post. All the posts are located in `_posts` folder. It arrangement is based on
date. For posts that we port from Kording lab original website, we put random date right now.
Each post can be written in markdown format. On top of each post, you just have to state 3 main things, `title`, `description` and `categories`. `description` will be shown when you share on social media like Facebook or twitter. See the following

```
---
title: Summer School in Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience (CoSMo)
description: all links to CoSMo summer school in computational neuroscience materials
categories: scientists
---
```

we have only 4 categories: `scientists`, `students`, `discussion`, `blog` you can choose.


### Way to add posts

**Directly add on Github**, you can simply go to `_posts` and click `New file` then put some markdown file e.g. `2016-02-03-post-name.md` and start writing blog post. Github also allows you to preview it so it's nice for people who don't want to clone the repo. **note** that you should commit or add description when you add more post!

**Clone the repo**, kind of the same as directly add post on Github. You just have to clone the repository. Then add more file, commit and push to the repo.

It will take half a minute and you can see the new posts or changes on [kordinglab.github.io](http://kordinglab.github.io/)!
