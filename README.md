### How to add posts

It's very easy to add post. All the posts are located in `_posts` folder. It arrangement is based on
date. For posts that we port from Kording lab original website, we put random date right now.
Each post can be written in markdown format. On top of each post, you just have to state 2 main things, `title` and `categories`. See the following

```
---
title: Summer School in Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience (CoSMo)
categories: scientists
---
```

we have only 4 categories: `scientists`, `students`, `discussion`, `blog` you can choose.
