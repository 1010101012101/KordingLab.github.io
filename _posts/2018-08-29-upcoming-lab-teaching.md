# Upcoming lab teachings

Every Friday, we get together (over pizza, sometimes) for lab teachings. 
On a rotating basis, each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know. 
Anything, really. Relevant and interesting topics, good skills to know, nice Python packages,
neuroscientific princples, new findings and literature reviews... whatever!

**Fall 2018/ Spring 2019 topics**

| Date | Name | Topic |
|------|------|-------|
|Feb. 27| 	Adrian Radillo | Perfecting the research process |
|Mar. 6| Ari | Einstein summation convention (in python)|
|Mar. 13|Greg Corder (http://www.corderlab.com/)|emotional processing of pain in the amygdala|
|Mar. 20| Ilenna | Topics in the Philosophy of Science |
|Mar. 27| Tony | TBA |
|Apr. 3| Rachit | Unity ML Agents |
|May. 8| Nidhi | Stability measures of nonlinear dynamical systems |
|May. 15| Ben | Representation and computation in neuroscience |


**Requests and suggestions**

1. Recent progress in NLP (Transformer networks, pretraining methods...)
2. Graph Convolution Technique

**Recently taught topics**
