title: Setting up Quadcorn for remote use
categories: blog

Purpose: Documenting how we configured @quadcorn for remote access.


**On the server**

Setup user accounts on quadcorn

```
>> sudo useradd --create-home USERNAME
```

Once you have created the users, setup the usergroup.

```
>> sudo groupadd -r GROUPNAME
```

Add each user the the group.

```
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user1
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user2
```

Open the SSH Daemon config file.

```
>> atom /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following lines to only allow our user group:

```
#Which groups of users to allow
AllowGroups GROUPNAME
```

Edit the port number with a custom PORT_NUMBER:

```
#What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
#Port 22
Port PORT_NUMBER
```

Check that X11 forwarding is set to yes:
```
X11Forwarding yes
```

We used:
GROUPNAME=kordinglab
PORT_NUMBER=5000

Once this is done, just restart the ssh server:
```
sudo service sshd restart
```

**On your client**
