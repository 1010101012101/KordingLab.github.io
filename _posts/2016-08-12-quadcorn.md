title: Setting up Quadcorn for remote use
categories: blog
---

Purpose: Documenting how we configured @quadcorn for remote access.


We mostly followed the instructions [here]
(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys)

## On the server

Setup user accounts on quadcorn

```
>> sudo useradd --create-home USERNAME
```

Once you have created the users, setup the usergroup.

```
>> sudo groupadd -r GROUPNAME
```

Add each user the the group.

```
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user1
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user2
```

Open the SSH Daemon config file.

```
>> atom /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following lines to only allow our user group:

```
#Which groups of users to allow
AllowGroups GROUPNAME
```

Edit the port number with a custom PORT_NUMBER:

```
#What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
#Port 22
Port PORT_NUMBER
```

Check that X11 forwarding is set to yes:

```
X11Forwarding yes
```

We used:

```
GROUPNAME=kordinglab
PORT_NUMBER=5000
```

Once this is done, just restart the ssh server:

```
sudo service sshd restart
```

## On your client

On the client, we need to let the ssh program know the host IP address, the user login, and the port to listen to. We can simply create the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```
>> atom ~/.ssh/config`
```

Type in the following:

```
Host quadcorn
  HostName IP_ADDRESS
  ForwardX11 yes
  Port PORT_NUMBER
  User USERNAME
```

Now to login to the server, simply type:

The IP address of our server is: `165.124.149.97`.

```
>> ssh quadcorn
```

This replaces the much more cumbersome option where you need to remember everything:

```
>> ssh -X -p PORT_NUMBER USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
```
